NAME

   jwgif - Johnny's Wireworld GIF creator.

REQUIREMENTS

   gcc
   GNU Plotutils
   GNU Smalltalk

COMPILATION

   ./compile.sh

USAGE
   
   jwgif FILENAME GENERATIONS WIDTH HEIGHT SQUARESIZE

OPTIONS

   FILENAME is a path to a Wireworld file - see WIREWORLD FILE FORMAT below.

   The following must be positive integers:

   GENERATIONS determines the number of frames produced.
   WIDTH the width of the output GIF, in pixels.
   HEIGHT the height of the output GIF, in pixels.
   SQUARESIZE the size of the square cells, in pixels.

WIREWORLD FILE FORMAT

   Wireworld is a cellular automaton with some similarities to Conway's Game of Life. It is 
   capable of doing sophisticated computations (e.g., calculating primeness!) with appropriate
   programs, and is much simpler to program for.

   A wireworld arena consists of a cartesian grid of cells, each of which can be in one of 
   four states. All cell transitions happen simultaneously. The cell transition rules are this:

   Input State       Output State      Condition
   empty             empty 	
   electron head     electron tail  	
   electron tail     conductor 	
   conductor         electron head     if 1 or 2 cells in the neighborhood of the cell are in the state “electron head”
   conductor         conductor         otherwise

   A Wireworld program can be stored in a file using the following notation:
   
   "H" for an electron head
   "t" for a tail
   "." for a conductor
   space for empty.
   
   Here is an example program, which demonstrates two cycle-3 generators and an inhibit gate:

   tH.........
   .   .
      ...
   .   .
   Ht.. ......

   The output for this program is included with the jwgif distribution, with the file name 3cycle.gif
